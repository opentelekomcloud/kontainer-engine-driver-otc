This repository contains the Open Telekom Cloud CCE cluster driver (a. k. a. the "Kontainer-Engine-Driver") for the [Rancher](https://www.rancher.com/) Enterprise Kubernetes Management platform.

Frontend part: 
 - https://github.com/opentelekomcloud/ui-cluster-driver-otc

## Prerequisites

This driver engine for the Open Telekom Cloud assumes that you have already the **cluster server** of the Rancher Enterprise Kubernetes management platform installed, either on one or several bare-metal-servers, in a Kubernetes cluster, or even in a single container. All options and a thorough discussion of all alternatives and options are covered by the [server installation manual](https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/pages-for-subheaders/installation-and-upgrade).

This driver is tested with **Rancher 2.7.9**. Any newer version should do. You need to create at least one user on the Rancher cluster server, a password, and the Rancher server log-in URL. For details, refer to the Rancher manual.

If you want to utilize **infrastructure resources provisioned by the Open Telekom Cloud**, you need exactly this very driver. The compute, network, and storage resources covered by the Open Telekom Cloud can be consumed and managed by the Rancher platform. You thus need **access credentials** for the Open Telekom Cloud. They come usually in form of a `clouds.yaml` file or an AK/SK pair.

Depending on your cluster setup, you may need **preconfigured network resources** such as a VPC, with at least one network, Internet connectivity for example via a NAT gateway or a router configuration associated with an EIP. You should upload an **SSH key pair** before you configure a new cluster. Please refer for all of this to your [Open Telekom Cloud documentation](https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/). These few tasks can be performed either via the [Open Telekom Cloud browser-based console](https://console.otc.t-systems.com/) or with a CLI tool like the [OpenStack Client](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/).
  
## Building

To build the driver from its Go sources, run `make build` from the main directory of this repository. 
The output driver binaries are dropped into the `bin` directory. These files can be imported 
directly into Rancher and used as cluster drivers.  They must be distributed 
via URLs that your Rancher instance can establish a connection to and download 
the driver binaries. For your convenience, this driver is distributed via a GitHub 
release and can be downloaded from one of those download URLs directly.

## Adding or Updating a Driver

1. Open your `Rancher` UI website and log into its service.

2. Go to the `Cluster Drivers` management screen in Rancher.

3. Go to `Drivers` -> `Cluster Drivers` and search for `Open Telekom Cloud CCE`. Click the three dotted menu and then `Edit`.

   <img src="https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/helpers/cluster_drivers.png" alt="image" style="width:1000px;height:auto;">

4. Alternatively just click `Add Cluster Driver`.

5. Enter Download URL:
    1) Using exact version: `https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/cluster/driver/1.1.1/kontainer-engine-driver-otccce_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
    2) Using the latest version: `https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/cluster/driver/latest/kontainer-engine-driver-otccce_linux_amd64.tar.gz`

6. Enter the Custom UI URL:
   1) Using exact version: `https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/cluster/ui/v1.2.0/component.js`.
   2) Or latest: `https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/cluster/ui/latest/component.js`.

7. Add Whitelist Domains with value `*.otc.t-systems.com`.

   <img src="https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/helpers/edit_cluster_driver.png" alt="image" style="width:600px;height:auto;">

8. Click `Save` if you are in edit mode of existing driver or `Create` for new one, and wait for driver status to be `Active`.

9. Cluster driver for OpenTelekomCloud CCE service will be available to use on the `Cluster:Create` screen.

## Creating a Cluster

> To establish a successful connection from yor Rancher agents to your cluster, you have to provide Internet access to your nodes. You can do that for example by creating a `NAT Gateway` for the VPC that hosts your cluster with either the CLI or the Console of the Open Telekom Cloud. Then add an `SNAT` rule for your `VPC` and `subnet` and pass the `EIP`.

> **WAITING FOR FIX** from **RANCHER**: Currently after cluster provision you must change `fleet-agent` pod image from default `image: rancher/fleet-agent:v0.8.1` to `image: rancher/fleet-agent:v0.9.0`

1. Go to `Clusters` and click `Create`.
   
2. Click on `Open Telekom Cloud CCE`.

3. Choose authentication method `AK/SK` or `Token-based`. The latter is recommended uses the same values and formats as configured in a `clouds.yaml` file. Fill in the required fields, such as `Region`, `Domain Name`, `Project Name`, `Username`, `Password`, `Access Key Id`, `Secret Access Key`.
   
   <img src="https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/helpers/auth.png" alt="image" style="width:800px;height:auto;">

   Then click `Next: Configure Cluster`.

4. On `Cluster Configuration` choose `Kubernetes version`
   > **Supported versions are 1.23 and 1.25**)

   `Cluster flavor`, `Network mode` and `CIDR`.

   <img src="https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/helpers/cluster.png" alt="image" style="width:800px;height:auto;">
   
   Then click `Next: Network Configuration`.
   
5. On `Network Configuration` choose `VPC` from list of created Vpcs and choose `Subnet`.
   
   <img src="https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/helpers/network.png" alt="image" style="width:800px;height:auto;">
   
   Then click `Next: Cluster Floating IP`.
   
6. On `Cluster Floating IP` you can create new IP with selected bandwidth size or use existing one.
   
   <img src="https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/helpers/ip.png" alt="image" style="width:800px;height:auto;">
   
   Then click `Next: Node Configuration`.
   
7. On `Node Configuration` choose `Node Count` 
   > Select at least three or more nodes, since Rancher wants a lot of resources.

   `Node OS`, `Availability Zone`, `Key Pair` and `Node Flavor`
   > `Node Flavor` list depends on a selected `Availability Zone`, so please choose that first.

   <img src="https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/helpers/node.png" alt="image" style="width:800px;height:auto;">
   
   Then click `Next: Nodes disk configuration`.
   
8. On `Node Configuration` select `Root Disk Type` and `Data Disk Type` and `sizes`.

   <img src="https://otc-rancher.obs.eu-de.otc.t-systems.com/helpers/disk.png" alt="image" style="width:800px;height:auto;">

   Then click `Finish & Create Cluster`. 

> Sometimes `Rancher` doesn't display the new cluster until all cluster node have been provisioned. If that happens, please wait and check the console. (WHERE/HOW?)
